requirement

1. Syntax Error / compile time error > occurs when we do not follow
syntax / grammar of the language

    CAN WE CORRECT THEM ? YES
2. Logical Error / Run Time Error > We always get result but that is not correct
  n1-n2  
  these are difficult to find out/ use debug feature
  CAN WE CORRECT THEM ? YES
3. Exception / Run Time Error > which might or might not occur
it depends what user enters at run time

 Enter age : 34 years
 CAN WE CORRECT THEM ? NO

  We have to handle them

  Exception Handling
  try
  catch
  finally

  try > it contains statements that can cause excaption
  catch > when some exception comes in catch block
  finally > optional , it will be invoked in both cases

   try > finally ---- if there is no exception
   try > catch > finally ---- if there is exception

    finally block shud be used for cleanup activities

Add User Defined Exception
  Create a class , inherit it from Execption class
     Add a property Message
     Add a constructor
      internal class CustomException : Exception
    {
        public string Message { get; set; }
        public CustomException(string message)
           {
            Message = message;
           }
         
    }

     We have throw these exceptions using throw keyword
